# RealTwitterBlue
Firefox extension to give Twitter a water background

How to:

1. Create a folder and download "manifest.json", "blue.js", the image of your choice, and "icons".
2. Go to add-ons manager and "debug"
3. Click "load temporary add-on"
4. Add either the manifest or blue.js and it will show Twitter with a new background.
5. You'll probably have to change the image path and everything, but it's like two lines of code.
   I'm fixing it up so it's a proper extension and adding button colors since Elon took them.
